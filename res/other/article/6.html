<h1>git 学习笔记（三）—— Generating SSH Keys</h1>
<p>If you have decided not to use the recommended HTTPS method, we can use SSH keys to establish a secure connection between your computer and GitHub. The steps below will walk you through generating an SSH key and then adding the public key to your GitHub account.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Check for SSH keys</h3>
<p>First, we need to check for existing ssh keys on your computer. Open up Git Bash and run:</p>
<pre>$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory</pre>
<p>Check the directory listing to see if you have a file named either id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub. If you don't have either of those files go to step 2. Otherwise, you already have an existing keypair, and you can skip to step 3.</p>
<p class="note">检查.ssh目录及 id_rsa.pub 和 id_dsa.pub 是否存在，如果存在请略过step2</p>

<h3>Step 2: Generate a new SSH key</h3>
<p>To generate a new SSH key, enter the code below. We want the default settings so when asked to enter a file in which to save the key, just press enter.</p>
<pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
# Generating public/private rsa key pair.
# Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
$ ssh-add id_rsa</pre>
<p>Now you need to enter a passphrase.</p>
<pre>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]</pre>
<p>Which should give you something like this:</p>
<pre>Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com</pre>
<p class="note">输入的密码是你在github上设置的密码</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add your SSH key to GitHub</h3>
<p>Run the following code to copy the key to your clipboard.</p>
<pre>$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard</pre>
<p><img src="{{res_path}}images/6_1.png"></p>

<h3>Step 4: Test everything out</h3>
<p>To make sure everything is working you'll now SSH to GitHub. When you do this, you will be asked to authenticate this action using your password, which for this purpose is the passphrase you created earlier. Don't change the git@github.com part. That's supposed to be there.</p>
<pre>$ ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to github</pre>
<p>You may see this warning:</p>
<pre>The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</pre>
<p>Don't worry, this is supposed to happen. Verify that the fingerprint matches the one here and type "yes".</p>
<pre>Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
provide shell access.</pre>
<p>If that username is correct, you've successfully set up your SSH key. Don't worry about the shell access thing, you don't want that anyway.</p>
<p>If you see "access denied" please consider using HTTPS instead of SSH. If you need SSH start at these instructions for diagnosing the issue.</p>

<h3>"access denied" 问题及解决方法</h3>
<pre>git fetch origin master报错：Permission denied (publickey).

$ ssh -T yywang1@github.com
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,192.30.252.131' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Permission denied (publickey).

$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase for /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa:（输入密码）
Identity added: /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa)

$ ssh-add -l
2048 dc:d7:ca:fe:5b:3a:bd:b6:78:f9:03:94:41:51:34:82 /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)

$ ssh -T git@github.com
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,192.30.252.131' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Hi yywang1! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
